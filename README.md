# COMPARISON-OF-DIFFERENT-NUMERICAL-TECHNIQUES-FOR-THE-SOLUTION-OF-SCHRODINGER-WAVE-EQUATION-
In this project we have discussed the Schrodinger Wave Equation which includes its time dependency and time independency for 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator through different numerical techniques for 1D Harmonic Oscillator . These numerical techniques include, Shooting method , Crank Nicolson and Compare it using Python Jupyter.

## Overview

This project numerically explores the solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator using two methods: **Shooting Method** and **Crank–Nicolson Method**. The simulations include:

1. Classical harmonic oscillator potential and energy.
2. Quantum stationary states and probabilities.
3. Time evolution of wave packets.

The code is implemented in Python using **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy**.

## Equations Implemented

**Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:**

`-(hbar^2 / (2*m)) * d^2(psi)/dx^2 + V(x) * psi(x) = E * psi(x)`

with harmonic potential:

`V(x) = (1/2) * m * omega^2 * x^2`

**Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:**

`i * hbar * d(psi)/dt = H * psi`

**Crank–Nicolson update (finite difference):**

`(I + i*H*dt/(2*hbar)) * psi(t+dt) = (I - i*H*dt/(2*hbar)) * psi(t)`

**Shooting method finite-difference approximation:**

`d^2(psi)/dx^2 ≈ (psi[i+1] - 2*psi[i] + psi[i-1]) / dx^2`

## Features

1. **Classical Harmonic Oscillator (CHO):**

   * Plots classical potential `V(x) = 1/2 k x^2`
   * Shows total energy and classical turning points ±A

2. **Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO):**

   * Computes first 4 stationary energy levels `E_n = hbar*omega*(n+1/2)`
   * Plots corresponding normalized wavefunctions `psi_n(x)` and probabilities `|psi_n(x)|^2`

3. **Shooting Method:**

   * Finds energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using finite-difference approach
   * Produces normalized wavefunctions and probability densities

4. **Crank–Nicolson Method:**

   * Computes stationary states by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix
   * Evolves arbitrary initial wave packets in time with unconditionally stable updates
   * Visualizes quantum dynamics: oscillations, spreading, interference

## Python Dependencies

* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy

Install via pip if needed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

---

## Usage

1. Run each Python script section to generate plots for classical and quantum oscillators.
2. Adjust parameters like mass `m`, frequency `omega`, spatial range `x_min`, `x_max`, or time steps `num_time_steps` for different simulations.
3. Observe:

   * Classical vs. quantum energy levels
   * Wavefunctions and probability densities
   * Time evolution of Gaussian wave packets

## Results

* Classical potential and turning points clearly illustrate energy conservation.
* Quantum stationary states show discrete energy levels and spatial probability distributions.
* Shooting method provides insight into eigenvalue problems.
* Crank–Nicolson allows full time evolution and demonstrates dynamic quantum behavior.
