# COMPARISON-OF-DIFFERENT-NUMERICAL-TECHNIQUES-FOR-THE-SOLUTION-OF-SCHRODINGER-WAVE-EQUATION-
In this project we have discussed the Schrodinger Wave Equation which includes its time dependency and time independency for 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator through different numerical techniques for 1D Harmonic Oscillator . These numerical techniques include, Shooting method , Crank Nicolson and Compare it using Python Jupyter.
